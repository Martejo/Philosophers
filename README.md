### Philosophers

The “Philosophers” project trains us to solve the classic problem of philosophers around a table, using threads and mutexes.  
This exercise focuses on learning the basics of threading, process synchronization and deadlock prevention.  
We have to create a simulation in which several threads of philosophers have to share resources (such as forks)  
without getting into deadlock situations, ensuring that all philosophers can eat, think and sleep without starving.
